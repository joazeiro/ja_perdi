# Not PhotoMath

Not PhotoMath is a interactive game for kids to learn basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). This game is still in progress and it is being created as our group's project for the ShellHacks Hackathon.<br><br>

This repository will be updated later on with images from the game
